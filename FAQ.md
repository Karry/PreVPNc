### Will PreVPNc support more VPN types? ###
Yes, but it isn't priority for this time. If you have some Linux/Java/JavaScript experience, you can write support for your favorite VPN type. Any help is welcome.

### Howto setup connection? ###
See [SetupVPNConnection](SetupVPNConnection.md) wiki page.

### Connection failed, what I can do? ###
At first, take a look on connection log and use Google. PreVPNc use pppd/pptp daemons on backround. If you fails with Google, open connection log, make printscreen and post it to [precentral.net forum](http://forums.precentral.net/showthread.php?p=2492449).
