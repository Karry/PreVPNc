=== Will PreVPNc support more VPN types? ===
Yes, but it isn't priority for this time. If you have some Linux/Java/JavaScript experience, you can write support for your favorite VPN type. Any help is welcome.

=== Howto setup connection? ===
See [Howto] wiki page.

=== Connection failed, what I can do? ===
At first, take a look on connection log and use Google. PreVPNc use pppd/pptp daemons on backround. If you fails with Google, open connection log, make printscreen and post it to [http://forums.precentral.net/showthread.php?p=2492449 precentral.net forum].
