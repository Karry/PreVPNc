# Patching for notifications #

Do you want be notified when your vpn connection fails? Install new version of PreVPNc (>= 0.1.4) and run script for patching luna ui:

```
wget http://prevpnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/luna-patches/patchit.sh -O /media/internal/patchit.sh
/media/internal/patchit.sh
```
You have to install "GNU patch" before. And keep in your mind, you do this on your own risk.
